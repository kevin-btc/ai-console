# ai-console
ai-console is an NPM package that extends console with console.ai(), sending logs to OpenAI for translation into human-readable logs with possible solutions. It simplifies debugging by providing better context and guidance, saving time and frustration. Just install it, require it, and use console.ai() instead of console.log().
